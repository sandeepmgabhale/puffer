pUFFEr
======


pUFFEr : A framework to allow conversions between fixed length messages and objects.

Puffer allows conversion of fixed length messages to Objects in a declarative manner, the developer only has to use annotations and the framework takes care of the rest.

Puffer offers the following features:

* Offers out f the box type conversion for all basic java types and the framework allows creation of Custom Type converters for types that are not intrinsically supported.
* Out of the box padding for fixed length messages, the framework allows the programmer to specify the padding character and padding side for any given field.
* Declaratively handles conversion of Numbers (with different notations for negative and positive numbers)
* Automatically handles the mapping of message segments (a list of segment where the number of segments is not fixed) to java Lists.
* Allows Inheritance mapping and runtime discovery of which concrete class messages should be mapped to by using field discriminators. This applies not only to the top level class but also to mapped component Messages and mapped List Segments allowing a great deal of flexibility.



Simple Example
----
For the class:

```Java
class OrderDetail implements Packet{

	@PacketMessage(position=1, length=5)
	private String name;

	@PacketMessage(position=2, length=8)
	@TemporalFormat("ddMMyyyy")
	private Date date;

	@PacketMessage(position=3, length=5)
	private Long amount;
}
```


And a fixed message "Item11508201300100"

The conversion is as simple as follows

```Java
String message = "Item11508201300100";
//Method 1 : Creating a object and calling parse
OrderDetail detail = new OrderDetail();
detail.parse(message);

//Method 2: Allowing the framework to create the object (class must have zero-arg constructor)
OrderDetail detail = Packet.parse(OrderDetail.class, message);
```

Custom Converters
----
Puffers allows developers to specify how the fixed length message should be converted to and from a field by using Converters.
Although all the basic conversions are handeled, users can create their own Converters.

Example: The fixed length field contains an amount, which maps to a Double, however in the message there are no decimal points, the last two digits are considered to be the decimals. In this case a developer would write their own converter:

```Java
public class AmountConverter implements Converter<Double> {

	//Provided by framework
	private Converter<Number> delegate = new NumberConverter();

	@Override
	public Double hydrate(Field field, String message) {
		//Cast to Double since the field object identifies it as a Double
		Double value = (Double)delegate.hydrate(field,message);
		return value/100; //Divide by hundred to move the decimal
	}

	@Override
	public String stringify(Field field, Double entity) {
		return delegate.stringify(field, entity*100);
	}

}
```
and now in the class:

```Java
class OrderDetail implements Packet{

	@PacketMessage(position=1, length=10)
	private String name;

	@PacketMessage(position=2, length=8)
	@TemporalFormat("ddMMyyyy")
	private Date date;

	@PacketMessage(position=3, length=5, converter=AmountConverter.class)
	private Double amount;

}
```

Component and List Mapping
--------
Puffer also maps One-to-One and One-to-Many relationships in fixed messages. The restriction being that all mapped classes using the pUFFEr annotations should inherit from AbstractPacket.

```Java
public class InnerMessage implements Packet {

	@PacketMessage(length = 1, position = 1)
	private String identifier;

	@PacketMessage(length = 5, position = 2)
	private String name;

}
```

```Java
public class ComponentMessage implements Packet {

	@PacketMessage(length = 3, position = 1)
	private String identifier;

	@PacketMessage(length = 5, position = 2)
	private Long amount;

}
```

```Java
public class Message implements Packet {

	@PacketMessage(length = 10, position = 1)
	String details;

	/*Example of Component mapping*/
	@PacketMessage(length = 10, position = 2)
	ComponentMessage component;

    /*Example of List mapping*/
	@PacketMessage(length = 6, position = 3)
	@PacketList
	List<InnerMessage> messages;

}
```



Discriminator
-----
The most powerful feature of puffer is the use of discriminators; it allows developers to use annotations to specify which concrete instance of the object should be created at runtime based on the contents of a message.

```Java
	@Packet(description = "Packet to test Discriminators")
	@DiscriminatorField(fieldName = "fld1",
		values = { @DiscriminatorValue(fieldValues = {"ABC", "abc" }, targetClass = Derived1.class),
					@DiscriminatorValue(fieldValues = {"XYZ", "xyz" }, targetClass = Middle.class)})
	public abstract class Base implements Packet {
		@PacketMessage(length = 4, position = 1)
		String dummy;

		@PacketMessage(length = 3, position = 2)
		String fld1;

		@PacketMessage(length = 1, position = 3)
		@BooleanFormat
		Boolean val;
	}


	@DiscriminatorField(fieldName = "subPacket",
	values = { @DiscriminatorValue(fieldValues = {"ABC", "abc" }, targetClass = ReDerived.class),
				@DiscriminatorValue(fieldValues = {"XYZ", "xyz" }, targetClass = ReDerived2.class)})
	public class Middle extends Base{
		@PacketMessage(length=3, position=4)
		String subPacket;
	}

	public class ReDerived extends Middle{
		@PacketMessage(length=5, position=5)
		Long amt;
	}

	public class ReDerived2 extends Middle{
		@PacketMessage(length=15, position=5)
		String desc;
	}
```

The following call will yeild an instance of ReDerived2

```Java
String input = "----xyzNXYZFive Hundred   ";
Packet packet= Packet.parse(Base.class, input);
System.out.println(packet.getClass().getCannonicalName());//Will give the full name of ReDerived2
```

This is because Base.fld1 mapped to xyz, which results in the target object being of the type Middle.
In Middle the field subPacket mapped to XYZ, this lead to the target class being ReDerived2, and since ReDerived2 does not have any discriminators, this was the class whose object was created by the framework.
